NFT Auction Contract
Project Description
The NFT Auction Contract is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity language. This contract enables users to participate in competitive bidding for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where the highest bidder wins the auction. The contract manages the entire auction lifecycle, from bid placement to final settlement, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.
Key features include:

Secure Bidding System: Users can place bids with STX tokens
Automatic Fund Management: Previous bids are automatically returned when outbid
Time-based Auctions: Auctions have defined end blocks for fair competition
Winner Selection: Highest bidder automatically wins when auction ends
Trustless Settlement: Automatic transfer of NFTs and funds upon auction completion

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized, transparent, and efficient marketplace for NFT auctions on the Stacks blockchain. We aim to:

Democratize NFT Trading: Make NFT auctions accessible to everyone without intermediaries
Ensure Fair Competition: Implement transparent bidding mechanisms with equal opportunities
Build Trust: Create a secure environment where all transactions are verifiable on-chain
